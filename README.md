# Dockmon

With Dockmon, you can monitor all your Docker containers with ease, get an overview, and always make sure your containers are running.

To use Dockmon with your Docker or Kubernetes deployment, you need to install Portainer as a container. Portainer is an open-source Docker/Kubernetes management tool, which enables the Docker API required by Dockmon.

Just run Portainer as one of your containers and access the web interface to create a new user account, which you then can use in the app to authenticate yourself.
